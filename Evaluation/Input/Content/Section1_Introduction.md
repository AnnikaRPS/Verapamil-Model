Verapamil is used for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina (chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart), and supraventricular tachycardia.

Verapamil is administered as a 1:1 racemat of R- and S-verapamil which are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 to S- and R-norverapamil. All four entities are mechanism-based inactivators of CYP3A4 and non-competitive inhibitors of P-gp. 

The presented verapamil model was established using observed concentration-time profiles of more than 45 clinical studies with doses from 0.1 mg to 250 mg in different verapamil dosing schedules including multiple doses and different routes of administration (intravenous, single and multiple oral administration). It includes enantioselective plasma protein binding, enantioselective metabolism by CYP3A4, non-stereospecific P-gp transport, and passive glomerular filtration 
The model building and application has been published by Hanke *et al.* 2020 ([Hanke 2020](#5-references)). 

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for verapamil in (healthy) adults.
