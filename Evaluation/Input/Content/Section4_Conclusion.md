The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of R-verapamil, S-verapamil, R-norverapamil and S-norverapamil after single and multiple administration of a variety of doses to healthy adults.  Furthermore, mechanism-based CYP3A4 (auto-) inactivation on verapamil itself can be described well with the optimized parameterization.
