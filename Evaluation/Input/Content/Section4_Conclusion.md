The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of verapamil after single and multiple administration of a variety of doses to healthy adults.  Furthermore, CYP3A4 inhibition on verapamil itself can be described well with the optimized parameterization. 

In conclusion, the presented verapamil PBPK model is well-suited to be applied in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug-interaction scenarios.
